Line extractor for text files.
See line.1 and/or line.man.html for documentation.
See http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/src/#line for possible updates.

To build, just invoke `make'.  There are no configuration options,
and there is no config script.  (The source code should be widely
portable, i.e. to any ANSI C environment, as-is.)

These source files can build a second, related program, called
`extract', which extracts numbered bytes and byte ranges from
binary files, analogously to the way `line' extracts numbered
lines from test files.  See extract.1 and/or extract.man.html
for documentation; "make extract" to build.

These programs and their source files are in the Public Domain.

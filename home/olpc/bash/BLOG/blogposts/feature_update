BLOG_KEYWORDS: internet testing 
BLOG_TITLE: Feature creep hits the blog.  
<p>Slight software update.  Now each category has its own RSS feed, and the whole blog is syndicated via RSS autodiscovery.   Autodiscovery is a pretty fancy name for a 'link rel=' tag that contains a link to the sitewide feed.   RSS support bloated my script by over 60%, meaning the software that generates this site is now a whopping 163 lines of code. Next time I take a study break, I'll make it conform to some actual HTML standards; the RSS feed is already valid RSS 2.0. Commenting will be delayed until I can figure out a way to scrub incoming text using shell tools.</p> <p>People keep asking me why I rolled my own blog in bash.  The answer is simple: I needed a portable, low-resource blog system.  There's already <a href='http://bashblogger.grimthing.com/'>Bashblogger</a>, but it depends on a bunch of stuff and seems overly complicated.  Mine has no config files, no caching, doesn't scale, and has very few features in general, but I understand the code.  Better: as long as my system has some standard stuff  (sed, grep, util-linux, etc.) it'll run just about anywhere.  If you notice any glaring errors, let me know.</p>  <p><span class="small">edit - Tue Apr 22 12:59:10 CDT 2008</span></p> <p>Study break came, and this is now valid HTML 4.01 Strict.  TAKE THAT, WEB 2.0</p>
